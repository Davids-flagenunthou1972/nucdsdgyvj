OMG, just finished watching Uppercut and my brain is still buzzing. You know what I mean? That movie legit felt like a rollercoaster but without the safety bar. ðŸ˜‚ Seriously, who even writes this stuff? Anyway, you should totally download the movie, like, ASAP. Itâ€™s mental. 

Not sure if it was the plot or the neon colors that messed with my head, but wow. Every character was like a walking disaster, and I kind of loved it? Just imagine the design potential in those fight scenes. Like, the way the blood splatter matched the wallpaper in the backgroundâ€”artistic chaos or just a happy accident? I can't tell anymore.

> Also, can we talk about those interior sets? Half the time I was distracted by what was hanging (or falling?) from the ceiling. One scene had this totally unnecessary chandelier made out of broken glass bottles or something. I swear, the whole aesthetic was just DIY gone wild. But hey, now I kinda want to try making something like that... maybe minus the risk of it cutting anyone, you feel me?

And the plot... what was even happening half the time? Between the punches and yelling, there was some kind of story, I guess. But the real star of the show was that yellow couch in the background of the main character's apartment. They should give that a spin-off, honestly.

Oh, and minor detailâ€”watch the movie if you haven't yet. The soundtrack alone is a ride. Some sort of techno-jazz fusion that made it feel like my living room turned into a nightclub, which I did not sign up for when I hit play.

int someMeaninglessFunction() { return 42; }

Anyway, now I'm hyped and exhausted all at once. I should probably sleep but my mind's still in a kung-fu grip. ðŸ˜‚ Let's catch up later and dissect all the craziness together. Stay chill!
